      <description>The Managed Resource is the CR that interfaces directly to the cloud infrastructure. It represents a unit of external infrastructure. It interfaces directly with the backing cloud provider.
The Composite Resource (check wording) is the collection of one ore more managed resources that provides the platform engineer abstraction from the underlying complexities of the infrastructure.
The Composite Resource claim is the means by which an application developer can dynamically request infrastructure with a simple abstraction that just expresses what he wants to get his work done.</description>

      <description>I am a platform engineer at Anynines, where I work on building and designing Kubernetes control plane components for managing data services at scale. I am interested in thinking about distributed systems, Linux and security. My drive is in conceiving, designing, and improving systems that can make computers and organisations work better.
Outside of that, I like mountain biking and high quality audio.</description>
